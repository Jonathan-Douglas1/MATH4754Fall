# Tasks

## Task 1:

```{r}
getwd()
#Hello
```

## Task 2:
```{r}
ddt <- read.csv("DDT-1.csv", header = TRUE)
head(ddt)
```

## Task 3:
```{r}
#Print the head of ddt
head(ddt)
```
The qualitative variables in dtt are "River" and "Species". The quantitative variables are mile, length, weight, and ddt.

To find the number of species: Use the unique() method
```{r}
#Number of species in the dataset
unique(ddt$SPECIES) %>% length()
```

Subset the dataset so to show the observations with SPECIES of LMBASS and WEIGHT bigger than 800gms
```{r}
#Filter and print the data
ddt %>% filter(SPECIES == "LMBASS" & WEIGHT > 800)
```
Subset the dataset so to show the observations where the RIVER is SCM and DDT bigger than 4.0

```{r}

```





## Task 4:


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
